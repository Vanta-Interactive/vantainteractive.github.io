Design, build and manage prisons, in a brand new game from Vanta Interactive.

Introducing **Prisonia**, a top-down 2D prison management game developed using Unreal Engine 5.

Create, customize, and manage every aspect of your prison. From layout design to inmate rehabilitation programs, the fate of your facility rests in your hands.

Prisonia features familiar mechanics seen in games such as Prison Architect and The Escapists 2, with a deeper focus on customization, mod support using Lua, UI theming support, additional AI behaviors, staff, items and construction materials, new research, programs, events, multi-floor construction support, stairs, elevators, additional management tools, utilities, unique wardens with their own special abilities, and much more, which allow you to manage as many aspects of your facility as possible. No microtransactions, no DLCs, just a one-time $25 purchase.

**Prisonia will arrive in Early Access later this year on Steam and Itch.Io, with native Windows and Linux builds**

*Post-launch roadmap:*

- Steam Deck support
- Additional modding capabilities
- Escape Mode
- transport prisons
- Themed updates on a bi-weekly or monthly schedule featuring prisons, new features, additional customization, cosmetics, upgrades, programs
- a story Campaign, moddable campaigns
- Weather events such as storms, floods, earthquakes
- Migration to the Sapphire game engine (>2025)

### Disclaimer
*NOTE: As Prisonia will be part of the Early Access program, features and mechanics are subject to change at any time.*
