As the title suggests, we are thrilled to unveil Devlog Three along with its eagerly awaited release date. For those seeking the date upfront, you'll find it conveniently located at the bottom of this post.

Feature Showcase:

Maps:
- Arctic Hangar
- Russel's Hideout
- Radio Station

Features:
- The weapon system is slated to be finalized by the time of the video release.
- Implementation of a custom destruction system for items.
- Introduction of a custom, sleek, minimalist, and reorganized menu.
- The storyline for Episode Three is now complete, with production set to commence in February-March 2021.

Moreover, in a change from our previous plans, we have decided to forego the GRAV0RTAL Launcher concept mentioned in the last update. We have devised an alternative solution that we believe is superior.

The episodes will now be offered as downloadable content (DLCs) bundled together, rather than being sold separately, through Steam.

Without further ado, mark your calendars for the release of Devlog Three:

Devlog Three - December 28, 2020
