## Release
JumpGame version 1.0 is now available to the public. In this version, are able to traverse, explore, and engage in jumping mechanics within the game environment. This was developed in three days.

Here is the changelog for version 1.0:

- Addition of three new maps: City, Ice Station, and Subway.
- Introduction of a secret feature.
- Inclusion of graphics, video, resolution, and audio settings.
- Implementation of a menu system, changelog display, and achievements feature.

It is worth noting that the size of the game is substantial, with an uncompressed size of 9.20GB. However, a self-extracting archive created using 7Zip is available, reducing the size to approximately 2GB. This is notably less than the previous archive created with WinRAR, which ranged from 2.3 to 2.4GB.

## Update
The game has been uploaded to Dropbox. Please visit the [Game Downloads]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/games/JumpGame) page to access the download link. Unfortunately, for fans on ModDB, I regret to inform you that I will not be pursuing the same uploading process as before. Please use the provided Dropbox link as the sole means to download the game.
