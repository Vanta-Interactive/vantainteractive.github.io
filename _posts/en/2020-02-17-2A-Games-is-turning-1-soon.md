We are delighted to share with you all that we are nearing a significant milestone: 2A Games will soon be celebrating its first anniversary, which is just four months away!

In light of this impending occasion, I have taken the initiative to create a survey aimed at gathering feedback from our community. This survey will serve as a valuable tool in our efforts to enhance the website, which is slated for a redesign around the month of August.

Your input and insights are invaluable to us as we strive to make 2A a more enjoyable and user-friendly platform. I encourage each and every one of you to participate in the survey and share your thoughts and suggestions.

Thank you for your continued support as we embark on this journey of improvement together.
