Acknowledging the outdated appearance of our previous website, we've decided to embrace the spirit of renewal that accompanies the start of a new year. As they say, "New Year, New Me" - or in our case, a fresh site and logo overhaul for 2020! Please refrain from expressing frustration over this change, and do note that the mobile version is currently experiencing some technical difficulties, which we are diligently addressing.

The transformation extends to our logo as well - bid farewell to the square, simplistic emblem, and say hello to its revamped, aesthetically pleasing counterpart.

I understand the anticipation surrounding GRAVORTAL, the project we've been pouring my heart and soul into. Rest assured, We are diligently working towards providing you all with a sneak peek and a 10-20 minute gameplay preview come June.

Let us remain optimistic that these updates to our website and logo will serve to enhance your experience.

Oh, and before we wrap up, we're excited to announce the addition of a music player featuring original compositions crafted right here at 2A Games.
