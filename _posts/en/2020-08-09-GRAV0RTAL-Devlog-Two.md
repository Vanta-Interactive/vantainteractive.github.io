Greetings! Allow us to present some significant updates in the second installment of our development log for GRAV0RTAL.

Devlog Two will debut on YouTube, with announcements posted on both YouTube and Instagram (@gravortalgame).

For those who prefer written content, a summary of Devlog Two will be provided on this website. Expect insights into concept art and changes made, spanning approximately 15 minutes in duration, sans gameplay.

In September, we will unveil in-game cinematic screenshots showcasing various maps and assets.

Not only that,here are some more amazing news!     

Here's a brief rundown of recent developments:

- Commenced work on the storyline for episode 3, outlining concepts for maps, characters, weapons, and items.
- Progressing on the soundtrack.
- Episode 4 development will be deferred in favor of Portal 3 development, with Episode 4 resuming in October 2023 and Portal 3 in February 2022.
- Crafting a small game launcher for our smaller projects, tech demos, and demos (each title will offer at least a demo, with GRAV0RTAL's demo scheduled for late October 2023).
- Commenced capturing reference photos of landscapes and Russian/communist buildings for episodes 3 and 4.
 

Further brainstorming has led to an innovative decision regarding GRAV0RTAL's distribution. When downloaded from Steam or the ECS Launcher (coming soon!), whether as a demo or full game, GRAV0RTAL will initially download a 3GB 'base' comprising backgrounds, music, effects, character blueprints, and other assets. Subsequently, a small launcher will prompt three options: Play, Downloadable Content, or Exit.

Downloadable content will include sections allowing users to download each of the three 'games' (Episode 3, 4, and Portal 3) individually. This approach aims to mitigate concerns over massive downloads by enabling users to select content as desired.

Anticipated sizes:

- All three titles combined: ~120GB
- Episode 3: ~30-55GB (largest)
- Episode 4: ~10-20GB
- Portal 3: ~20-40GB

Additional content:

- Patches (to be determined)
- Modkit (a zip version of the base game with example mods, ranging from items to characters and beyond): ~2-5GB
- Soundtrack (downloaded via Steam): ~1-5GB (high quality)
- Potential inclusion of a small 'artbook' showcasing concepts, development insights, and more (to be determined)

Community mods will remain freely accessible. Those interested in showcasing their mods via the mini-launcher can contact us at business_2agames@gmail.com, providing the mod, rationale for featuring it, and accompanying screenshots and artwork.

The Steam page will offer:

- GRAV0RTAL - Free Demo: Includes chapters 1-2 of all three titles
- GRAV0RTAL - Standard Edition: All three titles with complete chapters

Stay tuned for further updates on these developments.

Demo size: ~40-50GB (including chapters 1-2 of all three titles)

The substantial file sizes are attributed to the superior quality of assets, including:

- 320kbps sound effects and music
- Scalable textures/materials ranging from 2K to 8K
- High-quality models with LOD management handled by Unreal Engine itself
