## 2018-2023
**Vanta Interactive initially started out as an idea, back in April 2018**, before actually getting a name and trying to get seriously in game development, in the summer of 2019, when we started under the name '**2A Games**'. Then, we rebranded for a short while to **Evo-Catalyst Softworks** (ECS), and since late 2020, we're **Vanta Interactive** (*No more rebrands or name changes, we promise!*).

Our first release was a basic test game that was put together in three days, to learn more about Unreal Engine packaging on Windows, [JumpGame]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/games/JumpGame).

Later, an idea that has been in the background since 2017 became a part-time game project, *GRAV0RTAL*. Between 2020 and 2022 a few teasers were released, showcasing some of the progress on the game, such as weapons, the user interface and sounds. In 2022, the game was cancelled, due to the uncertainty for the project's future.

Other publicly-announced or teased projects were *Project CUBE* and *Frosted Planet*, both were in development for at most, weeks, before they were cancelled.

Ever since, there have been no public statements, teases or announcements from us.

## 2024
We have been working on a few projects behind the scenes, we have learned, we have improved significantly.

As of April 2024 - concomitantly with our website update, we have announced [Prisonia]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/games/Prisonia), a prison management game. Prisonia has been in on-and-off development since January 2024. The game will release in Early Access at the end of the month, and will continue to receive monthly updates for a while (estimated 2025), before it moves to a bi-monthly or trimestrial update cycle, ultimately moving to a long-term support update cycle. This will allow us to develop other projects (notably the Sapphire Game Engine), while still being able to ship regular updates.
